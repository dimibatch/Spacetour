# SPACETOUR
A gorgeous Angular app that I built with 2 other students. It's the app of Spacetour, a fictitious space travel agency.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Getting Started: Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
